# AI-Powered Smart Fare System
A smart QR-based fare system for buses with digital payments, trip tracking, and complaint management for Admins, Operators, and Passengers.
The AI-Powered Smart Fare System is an intelligent and centralized platform designed to modernize fare collection in public bus transportation. By replacing traditional ticketing methods with QR code scanning and AI-driven features, the system simplifies fare management for administrators, operators, and passengers. Passengers can easily scan a QR code on the bus, select their destination, and make digital payments, while AI algorithms handle dynamic fare calculation and fraud detection in real time.

This project addresses common challenges in existing fare systems such as high infrastructure cost, manual errors, lack of scalability, and limited user engagement. The solution supports secure role-based access, trip history tracking, automated fine enforcement, and a built-in complaint resolution module to enhance user experience and trust. With a lightweight tech stack and mobile-ready interface, the system is scalable, user-friendly, and ideal for deployment in smart city transit networks.
